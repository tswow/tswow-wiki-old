This is the official wiki for TSWoW, the modding framework for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.

The aim of this wiki is to contain a beginner-friendly introduction, documentation and practical examples for how to use this tool.

Anyone is welcome to contribute, but changes wonâ€™t be instant as they have to be reviewed by the TSWoW team manually.
